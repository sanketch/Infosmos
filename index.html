<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Idea Description</h3>
<p>Our idea is to create a web platform to allow the community to share information with each other, specifically in a way that matches people who have domain knowledge in a certain area to people who wants to learn more about the area and that person in return has a skill that the first person wants to improve on. 
</p>
<h4>How it will work?</h4>
<p>
It will work as a two way exchange, as in if person A has knowledge about French language and wants to get better at Chinese, he/she will use the platform to list what skills he/she has and what skills they want to improve. Our platform will match person A to person B who is good at Chinese but wants to get better at French. Such a platform allows for a two way free exchange compared to exisiting one way exchange where one party has to give some kind of monetary benefit in return. The platform will be using Facebook/Linkedin authentication and API in order to easily import users' existing skills listed on their public profile allowing users to do less work and quickly be matched. </p>
